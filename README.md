# etch-a-sketch

## What is this?

Another project where I am attempting to apply what I learned into a project for my portfolio.
The underlying theme here is DOM-Manipulation

## What do I have problems with?

I still have a disconnect between 2d-arrays and nodelist.
I created these divs through javascript to save me time, but I am having troubles seeing the **Distinct** difference here.

What's not shown is, that I am working with Typescript behind the scenes, the code is transpiled into es6 and I haven't much used typescript except for the typing and showing me how I should work wit ambigious types like this:
`let box = event.target as HTMLSelectElement;`.
It's quite helpful as it helps me think more about the types I am using and reduces uncertainty for a beginner.
